# App Description

This app pulls recipe information from a real API. If the API is not reachable, there is some hard coded data for the app to fall back on.

The app was written in React and is responsive. There is a server component to this application that fetches the data, but it has not been committed here to protect the authorization data.

More features to be added soon.

# Login Instructions

There is no real log in for the app, it just requires a string that is in the form of an actual e-mail address. E.g., abc@def.com
The password can be anything, it just cannot be blank.
